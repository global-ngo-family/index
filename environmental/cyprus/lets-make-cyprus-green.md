## Description
Let’s Make Cyprus Green is a non-profit organisation on a mission to spread awareness to the public about the negative human impact on the planet, in particular the harm caused by excessive and improper disposal of waste, and the use of plastic.

We take action to encourage both residents and visitors to the island to adopt a more eco-friendly lifestyle by “going green”. When you “go green” you gain knowledge and adopt new habits that lead to environmentally friendly & ecologically responsible choices in ways of living. This will help to protect the environment and sustain its natural resources. 

And the biggest part of this effort is you – the committed, caring people who are adopting the ‘go green’ movement by eschewing the use of harmful plastic and reducing waste. Come join us, and together, we can make our island – and the planet – a greener, better place!
