# Zero Food Waste Cyprus

## Specificity
Humanitarian supplies

## Location
Cyprus, Nicosia

## Description
Zero Food Waste Cyprus is an initiative based in Nicosia, that first took place in February 2018. It all started through the vision of one person to prevent food from being thrown away, which contributes to climate change as well as food inequality.

Alexia Kalourkoti came up with the brilliant idea to meet the local vendors at the "OXI" food market and through some fruitful discussions, managed to get their support.

They agreed that food waste "is an inefficient management of resources" and they were willing to donate to her, what would have otherwise been wasted.
