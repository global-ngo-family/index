## Description
The Larnaca-Famagusta Association for the Protection of Animals and Birds is an animal charity, founded in 1991. Our primary goal is the protection and welfare of animals and birds, through actions that support, promote and adjust their rights. We are a non-profit organization, financially supported by donations and proceeds from various events.

Our Association manages and maintains a shelter for stray dogs, the Aradippou Dog Shelter. It also takes care of stray, injured and sick animals in order to prepare them to be properly released in nature, in the cases of wild animals or to be adopted by families as pets in the case of dogs or cats.
