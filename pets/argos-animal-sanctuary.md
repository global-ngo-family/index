## Description
Argos Animal Sanctuary is a registered charity which was founded in the summer of 2008. Argos is a safe haven for abandoned, abused and injured animals in Cyprus - we provide safety, shelter and a life away from the streets. Help us protect them, care for them, and achieve our goal: to find a loving home for each one. All this we cannot do on our own, so help us give them the opportunity they deserve.

At Argos we believe that every animal has the right to have a happy, healthy life full of love and we do our very best to make our dream happen. We currently give homes to some 200 cats and dogs that have been either abused, abandoned or injured. Our main aim is to care for them and ensure their wellbeing until a new home can be found.
